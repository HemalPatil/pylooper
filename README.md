In the script in the video, the overdub mix ratio kept ging down even in 'play' mode.
This is fixed here.
This version can give you a count-in before recording starts.
After recording starts, the metronome continues to play for one full loop.

Run LoopSetup.py or LoopSetup.exe to set tempo, meter, loop length and count-in length.
Run AudioSetup.py or AudioSetup.exe to set sample rate, buffer size, latency and beep length.
Run Looper.py or Looper.exe to start looping.
